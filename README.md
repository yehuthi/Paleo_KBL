# Paleo_KBL

Paleo-Hebrew keyboard layout for Windows.

This layout is identical to the standard Hebrew keyboard layout, it just changes the alphabet script to Paleo-Hebrew.

# Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/yehuthi/Paleo_KBL/releases/latest) and run the `setup.exe` inside the archive.

# Usage 

Your language selection at the taskbar should now have two Hebrew entries, one with an additional subtext that says "Hebrew" and one without a subtext.
The one with subtext is the standard one, and the one without is the Paleo layout.
Whichever you choose will be the Hebrew you use and go back to on keyboard layout switch (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> by default).
