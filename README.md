# Paleo_KBL

Paleo-Hebrew keyboard layout for Windows.

This layout is identical to the standard Hebrew keyboard layout, it just changes the alphabet script to Paleo-Hebrew.

# Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/yehuthi/Paleo_KBL/releases/latest) and run the `setup.exe` inside the archive.

# Usage 

Your language selection at the taskbar should now have two Hebrew entries, one with an additional subtext that says "Hebrew" and one without a subtext.
The one with subtext is the standard one, and the one without is the Paleo layout.
Whichever you choose will be the Hebrew you use and go back to on keyboard layout switch (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> by default).

# Compatability

While it's not pervasive at all, some applications might have compatability issues. Some are baffled by this unusual input, some will not know what to do with it, and some will simply not support it.

If the program you try to type into:
- doesn't support it (typically some games): request them for full Unicode support, get declined, get depressed, move on.
- doesn't react to input (e.g. Telegram at time of writing): issue the developers a bug report and meanwhile write elsewhere and copy into where you wanted it written.
- doesn't display the letters correctly, just shows boxes □ or question marks �: it's likely the font that attempts to display the text is incompatible. If you can change it into one that does, do so. If you can't but it's reasonable for you to change the font, issue a bug report to the developers, and if not, consider this is a case of no support.
